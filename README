This is a complete source of Orca.
It runs on top of portability library Panda.
Panda is also included in this tar.

DISCLAIMER --- there is no longer any Transputer (server) around here,
	so we just assembled the source, but could not test the distribution.
	If you are really going to compile/run it, you must solve some
	minor installation problems:
	 - You must compile Orca and Panda using scripts ancpp-T800 and
	   mfilter, see for instance the compilation stuff in
	   panda2.0/lib/parix-T800/{Makefile,setup.mk}.
	To do so, you must
	 - figure out where the script ancpp.T800 is, and where it is
	   installed in the Orca tree
	 - figure out where mfilter is, and where it is installed in the Orca
	   tree.

There is a script setup in the directory ./orca/setup.
Run this script, answer its questions, follow its instructions, and hopefully
an installation is created.

To make Orca programs, use the Orca compiler script oc_panda, and pass
it as extra arguments:
   -parix-T800 -2
(-2 indicates the generation of Panda to use).
oc_panda is to be found in ~install/orca/bin after the build is complete.
