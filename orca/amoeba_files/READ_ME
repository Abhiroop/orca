		ORCA FOR AMOEBA

Date: Wed Sep 10 14:25:35 MET DST 1997

This directory contains an implementation of the Orca language for Amoeba,
either running on SPARC or Intel 80386/80486/Pentium.

This Orca distribution should be installed in /profile/module/orca, which can
be achieved by extracting the tar-file in /profile/module.

This file thus is /profile/module/orca/READ_ME.

The Orca language is described in /profile/module/orca/doc/refman.ps.

The compilation command 'oc_panda' is described in
/profile/module/orca/man/oc_panda.n. The files in /profile/module/orca/man
are cat-able.

The /profile/module/orca/examples directory contains some example Orca
programs.

This Orca version requires a recent version of the Amoeba GNU C compiler.
This can be obtained from the amoeba FTP site at

	/home/amoeba5.3/thirdp/gcc.am.tar.Z.

This file contains both the 80386 and the SPARC version of gcc.
It should be extracted in /profile/module, thereby creating a directory gcc.


Please send questions or bug reports to ceriel@cs.vu.nl.

IMPORTANT NOTE: we have found that there sometimes are some problems with
the Amoeba Ethernet drivers for Intel processors. If you have problems,
please try the -pan_chksum option. If that helps, you have the problem,
for which we have no fix.
