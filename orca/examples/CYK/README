There are two different programs in this directory:

-  StatPartAlg.imp ...
-  DynPartAlg.imp ...

They do the same things, but in different ways: 

   Given a context-free grammar and a string, they determine if the 
string is syntactically correct with respect to the contex-free grammar.

The output is a simple 'Yes' or 'No'.

In the file file cyk.string there are sample strings of which only the
top most is recognized. The grammar can be found in cyk.grammar.
The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.
