At the start of the WaTor program some questions are asked :


elementary dimension = the dimension for the elementary element(each
                       element is a square of this dimension). 
                       This value must be bigger than 3

number of operations = number of simulation steps

first dimension      = number of elemements on the vertical dimension

second dimension     = number of elements on the horizontal dimension

number of fishes     = number of the fishes at the beginning

number of sharks     = number of the sharks at the beginning

age of breeding for fishes = 

age of breeding for sharks = 

time of starvation    = maximum interval between meals for a shark

result file = name of a file in which results of the simulation are added

As an example :
==================

elementary dimension = 11
number of operations = 25
first dimension = 5
second dimension = 5
number of fishes = 4
number of sharks = 4
age of breeding for fishes = 2
age of breeding for sharks = 2
time of starvation = 4
result file = temp1
