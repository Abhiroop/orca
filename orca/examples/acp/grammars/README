input format for the grammars is as follows (in EBNF):

grammar          -> production rules <eoln> dictionary <eof>
production_rules -> {production_rule} <eoln>
production_rule  -> <left_symbol> '->' <right_symbol1> [<right_symbol_2>]

dictionary       -> {dict_rule} <eoln>
dict_rule        -> <left_symbol> '->' <right_symbol1>

Used notation: {a} : 0 or more times 'a'
               [a] : 0 or 1 time 'a'

<left_symbol>, <right_symbol_1> and <right_symbol_2> are strings of characters.
The maximum string length is 20.

Lines starting with a '#' are treated as comment and are ignored.
Furthermore whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) are allowed everywhere
in the input.
