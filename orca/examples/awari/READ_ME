Awari is a retrograde analysis program that computes an end-game database
for the Awari board game.

For performance measurements we used 13 pieces.

The randmerge program can be used to glue the output files together (each
CPU writes its own output file).
The randmerge usage can be obtained by calling it without arguments.
