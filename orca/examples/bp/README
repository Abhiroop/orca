This directory contains the ORCA program that implements the
backpropagation learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to teach an
arbitrary set of input-output pairs to a feedforward network.

The execution of the program consists of several phases: a teaching
phase, during which the network is taught a specified set of patterns,
and testing phases during which a set of input patterns is applied to
the network.

Two files are needed to train and test a network (there are test files
available for testing the program: DIGITS.IN, DIGITS.TEST, ADD.IN, and
ADD.TEST).

The first file, for the teaching phase, describes the input-output
pairs that must be taught to the network and its architecture. There
are two such files, "digits.in" and "add.in" (2 bits adder), available
that store training patterns.  The files contain:

	- the number of input units (or neurons)
	- the number of output units
	- the number of patterns
	- the input-output pairs
	- the number of layers (including input and output layers)
	- for each hidden layer, the number of units in the layer.

The second file contains a set of test patterns. Each pattern is
applied in turn, and the output computed by the network is displayed,
along with the input and the desired output. The files "digits.test"
and "add.test" contain respectively a set of noisy digits and test
patterns for the adder.

The files contain:

	- the number of patterns
	- the input-output pairs
