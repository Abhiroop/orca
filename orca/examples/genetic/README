			GENETIC ALGORITHMS IN ORCA
			--------------------------

This directory contains the codes of genetic algorithms written in
Orca, for solving the graph partition problem. The problem can be
stated as follows: partition a given graph into two sub-graphs having
the same number of nodes, by eliminating a minimum number of edges. The
problem is NP-complete.

One version uses an array for the representation of the population of
chromosomes. A second version was also implemented, which uses a GRAPH
structure for representing the population. Finally, a program for
solving the problem by an exhaustive search method was implemented.

The directory "array" contains the "array" version. The "graph" version
can be found in the directory "graph". The exhaustive search
version is in the "exhaustive" directory (this is a sequential program,
so in the following commands use 1 as <ncpus>).



COMPILATION
-----------

To compile the program for an execution under UNIX use the command:

	oc_unixproc -O2 --O -LIN -CHK genetic.imp

To compile the program for an execution under AMOEBA use the command:

	oc_panda -amoeba -O2 --O -LIN -CHK genetic.imp

RUNNING THE PROGRAM UNDER UNIX
------------------------------

Under UNIX the program can be run with the command

	a.out <ncpus> -OC <matrixfile>

where
	<ncpus> is the number of CPUs one wants to simulate
	<matrixfile> is the neme of the file which contains the description of the graph to partition, in the form of the adjacency matrix. An example file follows:

4
0 1 0 0 
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 0

where 
	4 is the number of nodes (4*4 adjacency matrix)
	1 represents the presence of an edge
	0 represents the absence of the edge

Some matrix files are provided with the program. Their names are:
	3cube.new
	4-3cube.new
	8-3cube.new

The file genetic.cfg is also used by the program. It includes specifications for the parameters of the  genetic algorithm. An example file is:

Number of generations 	: 10000
Number of individuals	: 2000
Migration rate	 	: 20
Number of migrators	: 10 
Crossover probability 	: 0.8
Mutation probability 	: 0.005

If one wants to run the program with a different set of parameters, changes must be made to this file. 
ATTENTION! The program looks for the colon character (:) in order to find a parameter value.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM UNDER AMOEBA
-----------------------------

To run the program under AMOEBA, it must be installed. Use the commend 

	ainstall a.out /home/genetic

to install the program in AMOEBA under the name "genetic". To run the program, use the command:

	gax genetic <ncpus> -OC <matrixfile>

The <matrixfile> and the genetic.cfg file must be present in AMOEBA, when the command is executed. Use the "tob" command (before gax), in order to transfer the files, as necessary:

tob genetic.cfg /home/genetic.cfg
tob <matrixfile> /home/<matrixfile>
