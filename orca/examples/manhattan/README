Hi,
 
I have now finished my project in your Parallel Programming course. The
project source code, Makefile, a final report and files required to run
the program are included in the attached zip file. 
 
To use the program do the following:  
 1. Execute the command 'unzip Delivery.zip' in a directory somewhere 
 2. Execute 'make amoeba' in order to compile and get an executable
installed on your amoeba account.
 3. Copy the files InitialDistribution and problem.tsp to your home
directory on the Amoeba system (or where you intend to run the program).
 4. Now you can run the program like any other with 
        gax mankrank N
                               
The report included is in postscript format and is called report.ps. 
                               
                               
I hope you will find everything in order.
                               
Best regards                   
                               
Mattias
