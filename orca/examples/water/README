This program is based om the "n-squared" Water application from the SPLASH
benchmark suite. The program has been rewritten in Orca.

To generate an input file, use the "geninput" program as follows:

geninput <timestep-length> <nr_timesteps> <nr_mols> <n_order> <n_print>

We used the following command to produce a suitable performance test
input file:

geninput 1.5e-16 5 1728 6 1 > input.1728
