This directory contains the sources of the various Orca runtime systems.
Some parts are system-independent:

IO		Implementation of the InOut module.

dataman		The data management part. Also contains the marshalling
		code, which assumes (for now) a homogeneous system.

misc		Routines for which no other logical place was created.

std		Orca standard modules/objects.

The system-dependent part resides in the directory "system", with a
sub-directory for each system.
