This directory contains the generic code for all system layers. Each
system that does not change one of these files, should create a
hard link to it, to facilitate keeping all copies consistent. The
following files are always architecture dependent:

pan_thread.[ch]
pan_sync.[ch]
pan_glocal.[ch]
pan_time.[ch]
pan_comm.c
pan_machdep.h
pan_system.c
pan_x_word.h

DON'T USE SYMBOLIC LINKS. Make can't handle them correctly.
